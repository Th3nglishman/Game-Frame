Game Frame: a frame for games

Our project Game-Frame includes our first prototype game PONG, many other game are still in development.
We use many different classes to split up and properly organize specific functionalities and methods into each class, such as separating textures and sprites in one class and hitboxes and game mechanics in separate classes.
