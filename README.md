# Game-Frame
Game Frame: a frame for games
-

This program was written by Elwin He, Krishan Patel, and John Whitney starting May 1.
This program is a simple interface for playing and experimenting with siplistic games easily without neccesity of an emulator or other secondary system. Anyone interested in the beginning of video games made enjoy this program to play games such as pong. When using this program it is important to remember that controls will be shown at the start with the exeption of the main menu which operates on a click to select interface. 







More description:
-
Our project Game-Frame includes our first prototype game PONG, with many other games still in development.
We use many different classes to split up and properly organize specific functionalities and methods into each class, associating them with different relationships of each other as shown in the UML Diagram. By separating different mechanics such as textures and sprites in one class and hitboxes and game mechanics in separate classes, it makes our project more organized since specific mechanics are easier to locate. The main interface you'll be interacting with is the GameFrame.java class.

For class names, methods, and fields please see the UML diagram.
