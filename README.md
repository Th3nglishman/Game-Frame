# Game-Frame
Game Frame: a frame for games

Our project Game-Frame includes our first prototype game PONG, many other game are still in development.
We use many different classes to split up and properly organize specific functionalities and methods into each class, associating them with different relationships of each other as shown in the UML Diagram. By separating different mechanics such as textures and sprites in one class and hitboxes and game mechanics in separate classes, it makes our project more organized since specific mechanics are easier to locate.
